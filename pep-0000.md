## What is a PEP?

PEP stands for Pepe Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Pepe community or describing a new feature for Pepe in a concise yet comprehensive manner.

PEPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Pepe.

PEPs are also used for documenting post-mortems, a process to identify the causes of an outage that results in compromising stability or security of the network, and how to defend from them or completely prevent them in the future.

PEPs are maintained as Markdown files in a versioned repository, and their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal, with each change being digitally signed by its author.

## PEP types

There are three kinds of PEP:

1. A feature PEP describes an extension to the Pepe protocol or a significant change to the Pepe imageboard.
2. A post-mortem PEP describes an outage within the Pepe network and the corresponding action items.
3. A process PEP describes a new process surrounding Pepe or proposes a change to an existing process.

## PEP workflow

The user whose digital signatures are made using Ed25519 key `4F3C4FFFD2A9303A7C8E90151B677B8F8BB20100` is declared the Pepe master. The Pepe master alone is responsible to assign PEP numbers and change their status. An important note: the Pepe master is not responsible for the content on the Pepe network, nor do they have any control over it.

The PEP process begins with a new idea for Pepe. It is highly recommended that a single PEP contains a single key proposal. If possible, validate your idea within the community first to avoid potentially wasted work. The Pepe master reserves the right to reject any proposal if it compromises the security of the network, or hurts the performance or usability of Pepe.

Each PEP must have a champion, someone who steps up to write a proposal using the style and format described below and sends it with a [pull request](https://github.com/1B677B8F8BB20100/peps/pulls) for review. After zero or more rounds of review, the new PEP gets submitted with an assigned number and the appropriate status.

Each feature PEP starts with the draft status at which point it is merely a lightweight design proposal describing the background (what the problem is, why it is important to solve it, any additional context for the community), one or multiple proposed solutions, each with a short overview of its implementation details, and the alternate design ideas that were considered but turned down. Only after that, the draft should get extended from a design proposal to a design document in an iterative and succinct manner.

For a feature PEP to become accepted, it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be functional and have been tested in the live research pool of Pepe nodes. Supporting results from analyses and simulations are also recommended where appropriate. It should include the rationale behind a proposal and may briefly summarize analytical, simulation, or experimental results where necessary to illustrate or motivate the enhancement. Including detailed analytical, simulation, and experiment results, especially comparing different approaches to the same problem should be avoided and instead cited from a published paper or its preprint.

Once a PEP has been accepted, the corresponding implementation must be completed, covered with tests and merged to the Pepe source tree. When the changes become scheduled for a forthcoming release, the status will be changed to final followed by the corresponding release version number in brackets.

If a PEP happens to get rejected after becoming a draft or if very similar but fundamentally flawed ideas get pitched again and again in pull requests, the Pepe master may publish it with the rejected status and the rationale behind its rejection in a separate note.

Post-mortem PEPs are very similar, they describe the background of an outage including its known impact on network stability and security, and the suspected root causes: Was there an attack on the network? What kind? Is there a design flaw in the protocol? A software bug in the implementation? After a usual review, such a PEP get submitted with the draft status.

For a post-mortem PEP to become accepted, it must meet similar criteria to feature PEPs. The root causes, if applicable, must be confirmed with results from analyses and simulations of the attack. A list of concrete action items must be composed. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be functional and have been tested in the live research pool of Pepe nodes.

The rest is identical to feature PEPs. To summarize, a typical track for post-mortems is the same as for feature PEPs: Draft -> Accepted -> Final.

Process PEPs have a different track and can be rejected, active, or obsolete. Thus, process PEPs can be replaced by a different process PEP, rendering the original obsolete. A process PEP can also get canceled as a whole in which case it will also get the obsolete status.

This document was heavily inspired by Python [PEP 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) and BitTorrent [BEP 1](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0001.html). Is is truly unfortunate the term PEP becomes overloaded, but I expect close to no confusion due to the very different nature and the problem domain of the two projects.
